   * This is the control logic for the quadcopter to reach the goals. It is a non blocking call and utilises the states to move to the goals. It start by calling the takeoff command, then moving the quad forward in the direction of the goal while moving it it up to the correct z height. It continues moving forward while constantly readjusting its orientation by turning to face the goal, then comes to a stop when it is close to the goal based on the set tolerance. Once coming to a complete stop, it then starts the control again to reach the next goal, when all goals are reach it exits the loop.
